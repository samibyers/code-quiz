# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
Description: The application I created is a quiz that tests the user's knowledge of coding. The application loads to a start page with a "start quiz" button. When the user clicks the button, a timer starts with 60 seconds left and they are presented with the first of five questions. When they answer the question, they are taken to the next question. If they answer incorrectly, then 10 seconds are subtracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. The user is taken to a page where their score is displayed and they have the option to enter their initials. If they click the submit button, they are taken to the view highscores page. They can also click the view highscores link at any time to be taken to this page. The "go back" button on the view highscores page takes them back to the start page. 

I wasn't able to get as far as being able to submit the user's initials to the highscores page where their scores are displayed or clear the highscores. There is currently an issue where if you go through the whole quiz, starting it again takes you to my placeholder question. I haven't figured out how to get around this yet without refreshing the page. I also noticed that the timer doesn't reset without refreshing the page. repeatedly clicking the view highscores link and the "go back" button mess with the timer. I need to fix these issues.
