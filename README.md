# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
Description: The application I created is a quiz that tests the user's knowledge of coding. The application loads to a start page with a "start quiz" button. When the user clicks the button, a timer starts with 60 seconds left and they are presented with the first of five questions. When they answer the question, they are taken to the next question. If they answer incorrectly, then 10 seconds are subtracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. The user is taken to a page where their score is displayed and they have the option to enter their initials. 

I wasn't able to get as far as being able to submit the user's initials and taking them to a highscores page where their scores are displayed and they can chose to go back to the start page or clear the highscores.
